My Experience:

- For the first time, I used the Tailwind CSS framework with React.
- I decided to learn Tailwind from documentation than just following the tutorial video.
- By building this project I am getting comfortable with React as I learned it at the start of this march.
- There are many things that I want to get better in React like react hooks.
- After using Tailwind I realised how much time I have saved by not worring about to give appropriate class name.
